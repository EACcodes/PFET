Before running the PFET calculations, you need to print out the grid 
and the AO basis on the grid. Grid can be obtained in the Molpro output
file. Molpro uses the quadrature grid and more information can be found
at https://www.molpro.net/info/2012.1/doc/manual/node184.html
It may also be helpful to check the cube command in Molpro manual at
https://www.molpro.net/info/2012.1/doc/manual/node503.html

The cube.F was originally coded up to plot properties such as density and
potential on a user-defined uniform grid. Here I modified the code so 
that it will use the DFT quadrature grid and ignore the defined uniform 
grid. For molecular systems, quadrature grids (in which the grid points 
are more densed near the nuclei) are faster and more accurate compared to
the uniform grid.
 

AO basis on the grid can be printed via modifying the code 
/scratch/gpfs/qou/Molpro_test/Molpro/scr/prop/cube.F:
1.Uncomment lines 1105, 1110, 1116
2.Issue: cd .. | make
3.Go back to working directory and run molpro sys1-1.com >ao_basis

To get the grid file:
1.Copy sys1-1.out to file3.txt
2.Locate the lines that correspond to the grid and cut off the rest;
  file3.txt should have the format # x y z where x y z is the coordinate
  of a grid point. 


cube.F is the main code that controls the inv_KS process in Molpro. After
you get the ao basis and the grid, go back to cube.F and comment lines 1105,
1110, and 1116, then uncomment line 1113 (so that it will print out the 
densities) and remake the executable. 

You also need to issue
vemb_ini.py 
in order to set up the initial embedding matrix. The variable
"a" in this script need to be adjusted as the # of basis functions.

test-ao.py controls the PFET calculation. The submission script is job.s

###TODO###
Right now, one still needs to hack Molpro's code (cube.F) in order to run 
PFET. (First print out the AO basis then modify cube.F and remake the exe
for the following PFET calculations.)
It would be great to set up some flags to let the cube.F know what to do.
Similar thing needs to be done for python scripts so that you don't need to 
modify the code each time.
